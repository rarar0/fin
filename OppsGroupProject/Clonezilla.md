# Progress this week

We seem to be nearing the end! It seems the current plan for this week is to try and clone a school desktop via Lucas' Pi 
and if that does not work the plan is to use clonezilla USBs directly on the affected systems. Creating those live boot USBs
was my task this week, and it was pretty straightforward.

## What is Clonezilla?

https://clonezilla.org/

## How do we get it to work?

1) [Run clonezilla via RAM](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live/doc/03_Disk_to_disk_clone/images/ocs-01-b-bootmenu.png)

2) [Select Remote Destination](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live/doc/03_One_image_to_multiple_disks/images/ocs-06-dev-img.png)

3) ???

4) Profit
